<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project


When I opened medium article, scrolled down, and realised it was only for premium members to read, and i already had exceeded the 3 free reads per month. I then realised that when you use incognito windows, you could access the articles. So, I made a script to scrape medium articles with incognito with Puppeteer.
